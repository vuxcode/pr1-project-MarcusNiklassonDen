
# Project Summary
 
> This project has been very difficult and very frustrating. If I managed to fix one thing, another one broke.
> The project is far from complete but I have learned a lot and will continue to develop my coding skills after the course is done.
> Even if I'm not completely done with the project I feel a slight satisfaction that I managed to make something using code, a language I knew nothing about 5 months ago.
